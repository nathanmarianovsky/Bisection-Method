Function (You are allowed to input any standard function such as the exponential, logarithm, cosine, etc...):
f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - 7
Interval (For Bisection Method):
[2,3]
Starting Point (For Newton's Method & Halley's Method):
2
Starting Points (For Secant Method):
[1,2]
Error:
0.0000000001

General Notes:
- If a proper interval is not provided on line 4, then the Bisection Method will not run.
- If a starting point is not provided on line 6, then Newton's Method and Halley's Method will not run.
- If starting points are not provided on line 8 in the form [x_0,x_1], then the Secant Method will not run.
