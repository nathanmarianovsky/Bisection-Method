Function (You are allowed to input any standard function such as the exponential, logarithm, cosine, etc...):
f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - 7
Interval (For Bisection Method):
[0,4]
Starting Point (For Newton's Method):
2
Error:
0.0000000001

Notes:
You can avoid running the Bisection Method on top of all the other algorithms by simply keeping line 4 blank.
Similarly you can run the Bisection Method strictly alone by keeping line 6 blank.
